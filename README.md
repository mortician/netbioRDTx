This is a pretty basic tool for Resident Evil Outbreak & Resident Evil Outbreak File 2's RDT files. I wrote it some time back when I was looking into Outbreak hacking with dchaps.
The files will be extracted and rebuild already in a proper way.
You can find the RDT files inside the NETBIOxx.DAT files on the game discs via tools like AFSExplorer.

You will find a folder for each extracted RDT in the apps "\RDT\" dir. Sadly we don't know too much about all the data inside Outbreak's RDTs.


NOTE: An installed Microsoft .NET Framework 4 is required to run the app.
